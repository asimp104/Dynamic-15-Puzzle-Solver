# Dynamic-15-Puzzle-Solver
The 15-puzzle has been an object of great mathemat-
ical interest since its invention in the 1860s. The puzzle has 16
square slots on a square board. The first 15 slots have square
pieces; the 16th slot is empty. The object of the puzzle is to slide
orthogonally the square pieces into the empty spot, thus rearrang-
ing the pieces and changing which slot is vacant, until the desired
configuration is obtained.

My goal for this project was to find non-optimal solutions to this puzzle for various board sizes.
