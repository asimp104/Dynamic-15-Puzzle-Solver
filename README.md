# Dynamic 15 Puzzle Solver
The 15-puzzle has been an object of great mathemat-
ical interest since its invention in the 1860s. The puzzle has 16
square slots on a square board. The first 15 slots have square
pieces; the 16th slot is empty. The object of the puzzle is to slide
orthogonally the square pieces into the empty spot, thus rearrang-
ing the pieces and changing which slot is vacant, until the desired
configuration is obtained.

My goal for this project was to find non-optimal solutions to solvable puzzles for various board sizes. 
From now on I will describe an $N^2-1$ Puzzle as a board of dimensions $N*N$ with tiles numbered $1$ - $N^2-1$
For example, the standard 15-puzzle is an $N^2-1$ puzzle with N=4.
